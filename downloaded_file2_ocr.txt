PART 2 - BIDDER INSTRUCTIONS

2.1 Standard Instructions, Clauses and Conditions

All instructions, clauses and conditions identified in the bid solicitation by number, date and title are set out in the
Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions Manual (https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-
clauses-and-conditions-manual) issued by Public Works and Government Services Canada.

Bidders who submit a bid agree to be bound by the instructions, clauses and conditions of the bid solicitation and accept
the clauses and conditions of the resulting contract.

The 2003 (2023-06-08) Standard Instructions - Goods or Services - Competitive Requirements, are incorporated by
reference into and form part of the bid solicitation.

Subsection 3.a) of Section 01, Integrity Provisions - Bid of the Standard Instructions 2003 incorporated by reference
above is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

a. atthe time of submitting an arrangement under the Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA), the Bidder has
already provided a list of names, as requested under the /neligibility and Suspension Policy. During this
procurement process, the Bidder must immediately inform Canada in writing of any changes affecting the list
of names.

2.2 Submission of Bids

Bids must be submitted only to the Department of Justice Canada Contracting Authority specified below by the date and
time indicated on page 1 of the bid solicitation:

Vinson.Lew@justice.gc.ca

2.3 Enquiries - Bid Solicitation
All enquiries must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Authority no later than three (3) calendar days before the bid
closing date. Enquiries received after that time may not be answered.

Bidders should reference as accurately as possible the numbered item of the bid solicitation to which the enquiry relates.
Care should be taken by Bidders to explain each question in sufficient detail in order to enable Canada to provide an
accurate answer. Technical enquiries that are of a proprietary nature must be clearly marked "proprietary" at each
relevant item. Items identified as "proprietary" will be treated as such except where Canada determines that the enquiry is
not of a proprietary nature. Canada may edit the question(s) or may request that the Bidder do so, so that the proprietary
nature of the question(s) is eliminated, and the enquiry can be answered to all Bidders. Enquiries not submitted in a form
that can be distributed to all Bidders may not be answered by Canada.

2.4 Applicable Laws
Any resulting contract must be interpreted and governed, and the relations between the parties determined, by the laws in
force in Ontario.

Bidders may, at their discretion, substitute the applicable laws of a Canadian province or territory of their choice without
affecting the validity of their bid, by deleting the name of the Canadian province or territory specified and inserting the
name of the Canadian province or territory of their choice. If no change is made, it acknowledges that the applicable laws
specified are acceptable to the Bidders.

2.5 Bid Challenge and Recourse Mechanisms
(a) Several mechanisms are available to potential suppliers to challenge aspects of the procurement process up to and
including contract award.

(b) Canada encourages suppliers to first bring their concerns to the attention of the Contracting Authority. Canada’s Buy
and Sell website, under the heading “Bid Challenge and Recourse Mechanisms” contains information on potential
complaint bodies such as:

e Office of the Procurement Ombudsman (OPO)
e Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT)

(c) Suppliers should note that there are strict deadlines for filing complaints, and the time periods vary depending on
the complaint body in question. Suppliers should therefore act quickly when they want to challenge any aspect of the
procurement process.
